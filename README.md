Here it finally is, after lengthy peregrinations , I managed to encode all of Chess's rules ( one I did not even wanted to, the fact that en passant is only possible for one move , but I checked and it worked ) .
I wanted to push it on the twentieth before I could code a better bot ( the heuristic functions are there if you care to check) .
